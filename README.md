# Ulster University Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates my data analysis skills, including SQL data retrieval, data preprocessing, pivot table analysis, and interactive dashboard creation using Power BI. The analysis was conducted on a dataset consisting of over 25,000 records across 10 tables, with the goal of uncovering trends and making data-driven recommendations.

## Features
- **SQL Data Retrieval & Cleaning**: Extracted and processed data from 10 tables, ensuring data quality by removing duplicates and inconsistencies.
- **Pivot Table Analysis**: Analyzed trends across 8 product categories and 10 customer segments.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Created interactive dashboards featuring 20+ visualizations for effective KPI tracking.
- **Business Insights & Strategy**: Formulated data-driven strategies projected to increase sales by 15%.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Data retrieval, preprocessing, and transformation)
- **Power BI** (Data visualization and dashboard creation)
- **Excel** (Pivot tables and data analysis)
- **Python (Optional)** (For additional data preprocessing and insights generation)

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ulster-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the SQL queries in a database management tool (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) to retrieve and preprocess data.
3. Load the processed data into Power BI for visualization.
4. Explore interactive dashboards and insights.

## Results
- Identified key trends in customer purchasing behavior.
- Recommended data-driven strategies that could lead to a **15% increase in sales**.
- Created visually compelling dashboards for clear data communication.

## Screenshots
(Add screenshots of SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, or Excel pivot tables to showcase the project.)

## Future Improvements
- Integrate machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Automate the data retrieval and preprocessing pipeline.
- Expand dashboards with more advanced filtering and insights.
